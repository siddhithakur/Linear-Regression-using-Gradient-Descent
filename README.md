Predicting House prices from average number of rooms per dwelling and percentage lower status of population
Batch Gradient Descent is implemented to predict the house prices and mean square error is used to get the error between actual and predicted values.
The Sci-kit learns Linear Regression is also used to predict the values and get the mean squared error.
