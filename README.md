# Linear-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent

Predicting House prices from average number of rooms per dwelling and percentage lower status of population
Batch Gradient Descent is implemented to predict the house prices and mean square error is used to get the error between actual and predicted values.
The Sci-kit learns Linear Regression is also used to predict the values and get the mean squared error.


# Dataset
Sklearns Boston Housing Dataset

# Implementation
Price of houses are predicted using Gradient Descent and Linear Regression in Scikit Learn library.

# Output
Shows the mean squared error between predicted and actual values of houses using both the methods
